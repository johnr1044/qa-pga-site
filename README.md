# qa-pga-site
End-to-end automated test using Playwright and TypeScript for the PGA Tour website. This test simulates a real user flow: searching for a player (Scottie Scheffler) and verifying that their profile page loads successfully. Part of a weekly QA portfolio challenge to demonstrate practical testing skills.
