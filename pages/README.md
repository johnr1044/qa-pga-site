# PGA Tour QA Testing Project


This is a Playwright-based end-to-end test suite for validating core functionality on the [PGATour.com](https://pgatour.com) website. This test simulates a real user flow: searching for a player (Scottie Scheffler) and verifying that their profile page loads successfully. 
 The test focuses on searching for a player and verifying navigation to their profile page.
